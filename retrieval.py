            Retrieval: “Structure and mechanical behavior of a toucan beak” by Yasuaki Seki, Matthew S. Schneider, Marc A. Meyers. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actamat.2005.04.048 \n\

            Abstract: \n\

            The toucan beak, which comprises one third of the length of the bird and yet only about 1/20th of its mass, has outstanding stiffness. The structure of a Toco toucan (Ramphastos toco) beak was found to be a sandwich composite with an exterior of keratin and a fibrous network of closed cells made of calcium-rich proteins. The keratin layer is comprised of superposed hexagonal scales (50 μm diameter and 1 μm thickness) glued together. Its tensile strength is about 50 MPa and Young’s modulus is 1.4 GPa. Micro and nanoindentation hardness measurements corroborate these values. The keratin shell exhibits a strain-rate sensitivity with a transition from slippage of the scales due to release of the organic glue, at a low strain rate (5 × 10−5/s) to fracture of the scales at a higher strain rate (1.5 × 10−3/s). The closed-cell foam is comprised of fibers having a Young’s modulus twice as high as the keratin shells due to their higher calcium content. The compressive response of the foam was modeled by the Gibson–Ashby constitutive equations for open and closed-cell foam. There is a synergistic effect between foam and shell evidenced by experiments and analysis establishing the separate responses of shell, foam, and foam + shell. The stability analysis developed by Karam and Gibson, assuming an idealized circular cross section, was applied to the beak. It shows that the foam stabilizes the deformation of the beak by providing an elastic foundation which increases its Brazier and buckling load under flexure loading. \n\
            Discover: The Toco Toucan's beak is a marvel of natural engineering. Despite its size, it is incredibly lightweight and strong. The beak's structure is composed of a foamy keratin material, reinforced with a network of bony fibers and drum-like membranes. This structure allows the beak to absorb and distribute impact forces effectively, reducing the force that reaches the bird's body. \n\
            Abstract: The essential feature that makes the Toco Toucan's beak successful in managing impact is its unique structure: a lightweight, foamy material reinforced with a network of fibers and membranes. In design terms, we can describe this strategy as follows: "A lightweight, porous material is reinforced with a network of fibers and membranes to absorb and distribute impact forces, reducing the force transmitted to the inner structure." \n\
            Answer: The nose of the airplane could be designed to mimic the structure of the Toco Toucan's beak. This would involve creating a lightweight yet strong material that can absorb impact effectively. The material could be structured in a similar way to the beak, with a network of fibers for added strength and flexibility. This design could potentially improve the safety and efficiency of air travel by better managing impact forces. \n\

            Biologize: The essential function we need to address is managing compression. In biological terms, we can ask, "How does nature resist and distribute compressive forces?"

            Abstract: \n\

            The microstructure of many echinoid species has long fascinated scientists because of its high porosity and outstanding mechanical properties. We have used X-ray microtomography to examine the test of Echinocardium cordatum (heart urchin), a burrowing cousin of the more commonly known sea urchins. Three dimensional imaging demonstrates that the bulk of the test is composed of only two distinct, highly porous, fenestrated regions (stereom), in which the thickness of the struts is constant. Different degrees of porosity are achieved by varying the spacing of the struts. Drawing an analogy to vertebrate trabecular bone, where for example, human bone has a connectivity density of ≈1/mm3, we measure up to 150,000 strut connections per mm3. Simulations of mechanical loading using finite element calculations indicate that the test performs at very close to the optimum expected for foams, highlighting the functional link between structure and mechanical properties. \n\
            Discover: The sea urchin's shell, or test, is a marvel of natural engineering. It is composed of numerous calcite plates arranged in a complex, geometric pattern. This structure, known as stereom, allows the shell to distribute pressure evenly across its surface, effectively resisting compression. The shell is also able to repair itself if damaged, further enhancing its durability \n\
            Abstract: The essential feature that makes the sea urchin's shell successful in managing compression is its unique structure: a complex, geometric pattern of calcite plates that distribute pressure evenly. In design terms, we can describe this strategy as follows: "A structure composed of numerous small, interlocking elements arranged in a complex pattern to distribute compressive forces evenly across the surface, enhancing resistance to compression." \n\
            Answer: The hull of the submarine could be designed to mimic the structure of the sea urchin's shell. This would involve creating a complex, geometric pattern of interlocking elements that can distribute pressure evenly, effectively resisting compression. This design could potentially improve the safety and efficiency of submarine travel by better managing compressive forces. \n\

            Question: How can I design a car engine that keeps cool? \n\

Specifically, we can look at the Apis mellifera, or honeybee, which has a unique way of cooling their hives. So, our biologized question becomes, "How does Apis mellifera manage temperature regulation?" \n\

            Abstract: \n\

            Avenues of water gain and loss in bees are examined here at two levels of organisation: the individual and the colony. Compared with the majority of terrestrial insects, bees have a high water turnover. This is due to their nectar diet and, in larger species, substantial metabolic water production during flight, counteracted by high evaporative and excretory losses. Water fluxes at the colony level can also be very high. When incoming nectar is dilute, honeybees need to remove large volumes of water by evaporation. On the other hand, water is not stored in the nest and must be collected for evaporative cooling and for feeding the brood. Water regulation has many similarities at individual and colony levels. In particular, manipulation of nectar or water on the tongue is extensively used by bees to increase evaporation for either food-concentrating or cooling purposes. \n\
            Discover: Honeybees use a collective cooling technique to regulate the temperature of their hive. When the temperature inside the hive becomes too high, worker bees collect water and distribute it throughout the hive. Other bees then fan their wings to evaporate the water, which cools the hive. This is a form of evaporative cooling, similar to sweating in humans \n\
            Abstract: The essential feature that makes the honeybee's temperature regulation successful is its use of evaporative cooling. In design terms, we can describe this strategy as follows: "A system uses a liquid (like water) distributed throughout its structure, and a method to promote evaporation, to cool the entire system." \n\
            Answer: The car engine could be designed to mimic the honeybee's evaporative cooling technique. This could involve a system where a coolant is distributed throughout the engine. A mechanism (like a fan) could then promote evaporation, cooling the engine. This design could potentially improve the efficiency of car engines by better managing heat. \n\
